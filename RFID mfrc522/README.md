  ## Introduction

  This is a simple code which makes use of dependencies from the RFID mfrc522 module.  
  Running it requires you to install the RFID mfrc522 module.  
  
  As of right now, this code allows you to read RFID tags. It does not yet allow you to write RFID tags.
  Writing RFID tags can be done more efficiently with arduino.
