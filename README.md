# Project GymNow

## Background

This was a group project to develop a GUI using Python and Kivy. <br>
The aim of the project was to design a smart solution to be deployed for smart campus applications in SUTD for its stake-holders.<br>

## Aim
GymNow aims to create a simple queueing system to manage the gym crowd and collect useful data for gym-goers to plan their schedule. <br>
<br>
`kv` folder contains all the .kv files used by the `GUI_GymNow.py` file to build the GUI. <br>
.kv files contains all the interface design componenets <br>
.py file contains all the functions and logic required by our system <br>
`prev_profiles.txt` is a sample database for past users for the autofill function. <br>

Below is the video URL for a demonstration of the system. <br>
