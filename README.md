# Project GymNow
My first project developing a GUI using KIVY <br>
Our project aims to create a simple queueing system to manage the gym crowd and collect useful data for gym-goers to plan their schedule. <br>
<br>
The .kv file is called and used by the .py file to build the GUI <br>
.kv file contains all the interface design componenets <br>
.py file contains all the functions and logic required by our system
